Aligned a new spot with a smaller angle of incidence (100mm lens with ~5mm offset between incident and reflected beam) ~2.8degrees
Power = 7.5*2mW
accidently after reaching 165K I cooled down to 5K and back to 170K :( measurement seems to be consistent at the high temp though even after the cooldown warmup


cooldown to 5K

5K fluences 

temperatures 19p7mW only short times

insert quarter waveplate and measured fluences

started a temperature run but the laser shut down in the middle of the measurement     "polarizations temp"

strted a new run   :    "polarization temp run2"
