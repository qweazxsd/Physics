virtual instruments (:mod:`skrf.vi`)
========================================================

This module defines "virtual instruments" or interfaces to a number of different
types of instruments used in RF measurements and experiments.

Creating A Driver
=================

Drivers are classes inherited from the respective instrument type's abstract base
class and define methods specific to each instrument. This syntax can be complex
and vary wildly between devices and manufacturers. The vi module attempts to
present a standard interface for each.

Basically, creating a driver consists of the following:

1. Creating an instrument class that inherits from its abstract base class
2. Consulting the device's datasheet to find the command for each method in the
   abstract base class

Those wishing to use an instrument that's not supported are encouraged to
consult existing classes to understand the architecture, develop their own
class, and contribute it to scikit-rf.

If you choose to do so, please try to use the following standard terms for the
associated meaning
