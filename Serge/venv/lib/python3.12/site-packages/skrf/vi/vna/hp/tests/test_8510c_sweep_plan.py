"""
The user requests a big sweep with different spacings in different frequency
blocks, but the HP8510 instrument only supports smaller sweeps with fixed
spacing. What to do? Break up the big sweep, naturally.

SweepPlan.from_hz(array_of_hz)
  ->
    SweepPlan
        SweepSection
        SweepSection
        SweepSection

Each SweepSection represents a sweep the instrument can actually perform.
Together, the SweepSections in a SweepPlan satisfy the user's request.

There is room for cleverness: conducting an 800 point sweep by running an
801 point sweep and discarding a point saved 20 minutes in a recent script.

Cleverness is only good if it works, and these tests make sure that
SweepPlan.from_hz returns a plan that hits exactly the frequencies it is
supposed to.
